📖 Escape Room Immersive Application – Sprint Project
📌 Overview
This project is a 3D immersive virtual reality (VR) game developed as part of our Module 7CS109 – Immersive Application Development. It aims to deliver a fun, engaging, and problem-solving experience for players in a series of themed escape rooms.

Players must solve puzzles, manage their time, and make decisions under pressure to escape each room before time runs out.

🎮 Game Concept
The application features three different rooms, each with its own environment, theme, and gameplay challenge:

Room 1 – Find Me On My Birthday
Theme: Hospital (Scary, Mystery, Horror)
Challenge: Guess the correct PIN code before the timer runs out or the floor collapses.

Room 2 – Sort It Out
Theme: Beach (Fresh, Tropical, Sandy)
Challenge: Use a detector tool to find and sort hidden objects before the island floods.

Room 3 – Play With Me
Theme: Meeting Room (Tense, Suspenseful)
Challenge: Play a timed tic-tac-toe game against a computer before the room catches fire.
